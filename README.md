Capsulate is a simple photo journaling web app.

There is no front-end framework and the backend is a node server.

I'm writing an in-depth log of my though process and progress in <progress_log.md>.

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Install dependancies with `npm i`
- Start the local server with `node index.js`
- View at <localhost:1998>

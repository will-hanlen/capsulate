Capsulate is a simple photo journaling app. My vision is to effortlessly document my life through photos without relying on an outside service to store my private photos and text.

## Usage

Capsulate is designed to be run on a personal server.
I run mine through Termux on my phone so that I can upload photo entries from anywhere.
Because of this, there is no need for authentication or security features.
You just open run the node express server locally and access the app through your browser.
All files are stored locally with the server.

The app provides a minimal UI to your journal.
Each entry is a short bit of text and an optional photo.
Whenever you upload a new entry you are shown a random previous entry to remind you of the past.
Simple and seamless.

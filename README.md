Capsulate is a simple photo journaling web app.
[Demo here](https://capsulate.vercel.app).

There is no front-end framework - everything is done with direct DOM manipulation and AJAX. The backend is an express node server.

I'm writing an in-depth log of my thought process and progress in [progress_log.md](progress_log.md).

Tasks are tracked in the [TODO](https://github.com/will-hanlen/capsulate/projects/1) project.

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Install dependancies with `npm i`
- Start the local server with `node index.js`
- View at [localhost:1998](localhost:1998)
